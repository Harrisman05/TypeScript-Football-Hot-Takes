public folder - used to place files that will be sent to webserver

src folder - contains files which contains all the source code, like typescript files which dont need to be deployed

tsconfig used to configure complilation to place compiled JS file in 

Steps to set up:

rootDir = folder with ts files in it (src)
outDir = public folder with compiled js files (public)

"rootDir": "./src"
"outDir": "./public" 

add "include": ["src"] property to prevent ts files outside of rootDir (src) from being compiled

run command -->
tsc -w
